## Employee Directory

## Description  
For this assignment, created an employee directory with React. This assignment broke up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.
